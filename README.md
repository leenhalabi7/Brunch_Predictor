# Brunch_Predictor

This repository contains a simulation of a 2-Level Branch Predictor, created as part of a Computer Architecture course at the Technion. The project evaluates the performance of branch prediction using configurable parameters such as history bits, BTB size, and prediction algorithms like Gshare and Lshare. The simulation analyzes real program traces and generates performance reports, helping understand the efficiency of different branch prediction methods.
